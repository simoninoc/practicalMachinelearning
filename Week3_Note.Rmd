#Predicting with tree
##Algorithm
Split between a variables that seperates most untile each group have enough purity.
##Measurement of purity
*Misclassification Error: 0.5 = no purity, 0 = perfect purity
*Gini Index: 0.5 = no purity, 0 = perfect purity
*Deviance/Imformation Gain: 0 = perfect purity, 1 = no purity

##Example: Iris data
```{r}
data(iris)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
names(iris)
table(iris$Species)
inTrain = createDataPartition(y = iris$Species, p =0.7,list = F)
training = iris[inTrain,]
test = iris[-inTrain,]
```

Predicting with trees in R
```{r}
modFit = train(Species~.,method = "rpart", data = training)
modFit$finalModel
plot(modFit$finalModel,uniform = T,main = "Classification Tree")
text(modFit$finalModel,use.n = T, all = T, cex= 1)#use.n print prediction outcome cex control font size

#####A better plot########
library(rattle)
```
